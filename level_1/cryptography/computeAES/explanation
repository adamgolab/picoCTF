Problem:
You found this clue laying around. Can you decrypt it?
Encrypted with AES in ECB mode. All values base64 encoded
ciphertext = rW4q3swEuIOEy8RTIp/DCMdNPtdYopSRXKSLYnX9NQe8z+LMsZ6Mx/x8pwGwofdZ
key = 6v3TyEgjUcQRnWuIhjdTBA==

Explanation:
Using python, and PyCrypto made a decryption script
Followed bottom example from docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/crpto/
Replaces AES.MODE_CBC with AES.MODE_ECB bc it was given in clue
