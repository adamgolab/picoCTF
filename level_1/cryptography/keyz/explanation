Problem:
While webshells are nice, it'd be nice to be able to login directly. To do so, please add your own public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. Make sure to copy it correctly! The key is in the ssh banner, displayed when you login remotely with ssh, to shell2017.picoctf.com.

Explanation:
SSH (Secure Socket Shell)
a network protocol that allows a secure way to access a remote computer

Generating an SSH Key on local device
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@address.com" 

cat id_rsa.pub
cat allows you to view content of a file, id_rsa.pub is the public key

authorized_keys
added public key to .ssh/authorized_keys on webshell

Local -> webshell
ssh -i/.ssh/id_rsa adamgolab@shell2017.picoctf.com
