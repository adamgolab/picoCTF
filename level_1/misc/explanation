Problem:
I was told there was something at IP shell2017.picoctf.com with port 24369.
 How do I get there? Do I need a ship for the port?

Explanation:
The hint tells us to look at what the netcat (nc) command does. Netcat operates by initiating
a TCP connection to a remote host. The basic syntax is: $ netcat host port
