Problem:
We found this annoyingly named directory tree strting at /problems/b70fe.... It would be pretty lame to type out all of those directory names but maybe there is something in there worth finding? And maybe we dont need to type out all those names...? Follow the trunk, using cat and ls!

Explanation:
Change Directory (cd)
cd .. -> to go up
cd directory -> to go into

List (ls)
ls -> lists files in current directory
ls -l -> lists files with permissions
ls -a -> lists all files including hidden files

Find (find)
Search for files in a directory hierarchy
