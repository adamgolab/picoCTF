Problem:
We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/bd05... and try it out!

Explanation:
#!/usr/bin/bash
for i in {#..#}
do
	$i
done

grep -v "string"
returns all strings that don't contain "string"
