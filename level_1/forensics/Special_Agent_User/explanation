Problem:
We can get into the Administrator's computer with a browser exploit. But first, we need to figure out what browser they're using. Perhaps this information is located in a network packet capture we took: data.pcap. Enter the browser and version as "BrowserName BrowserVersion". NOTE: We're just looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browers version (ie. Version 1.2.3 for Version 1.2.3.4) and ignore any 0th subversions (ie. 1.2 for 1.2.0)

Explanation:
Looking through the .pcap file, we can filter by HTTP requests. Then looking through the GET requests we can see some browser info labled User-Agent. Most of the GET requests have wget which looks like a computer program that retrieves content, so not a web browser. Looking through a few more GET requests, there's one that shows Chrome as the browser and includes the version number.
