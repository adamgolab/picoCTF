Problem:
We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: data.pcap.

Explanation:
A Packet Capture (pcap) consists of an API for capturing network traffic. Applications like libpcap and WinPcap provide packet-capturing and filtering engineers that allow saving into files that can be read via applications like Wireshark. 

A user entering a password would utlize an HTTP protocol, so sorting by protocol and looking for a POST method request we see a row labeled HTML Form URL Encoded which contains the form userid and the form pswrd. 

Looking at the password, it looks like it's encrypted. Google shows encryption ending with an == implies Base64.
